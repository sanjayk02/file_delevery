1. Basics of Machine Learning:

Data Collection and Cleaning in Maya:
Python, when coupled with Maya's API, makes data extraction a breeze.

import maya.cmds as cmds

# Get all objects in the scene
all_objects = cmds.ls(dag=True, long=True)

# Extracting transformations
obj_transforms = {}
for obj in all_objects:
    obj_transforms[obj] = cmds.getAttr(obj + ".translate")[0]
Feature Engineering for Animation:
Converting raw data into machine-friendly features is crucial. Imagine tracking the speed and direction of a character's hand movement; this can be transformed into a feature set for ML.



2. Predictive Animation:

Time-Series Forecasting for Object Motion:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, can predict object trajectories.

Python with TensorFlow example:

import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data: [time_step][x, y, z]
data = np.array([[[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]], [[2,3,4], [3,4,5], [4,5,6]]])

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(3, 3)))
model.add(Dense(3))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train on your data
model.fit(data, data, epochs=300, verbose=0)

Predicting Character Reactions:
For a character to duck when a ball approaches, we can train a model to recognize such cues and predict reactions.



3. Feedback Loops:

Reinforcement Learning in Maya:
Reinforcement learning can help characters optimize behaviors. Imagine teaching a character to walk; with each correct posture, it earns a reward.

import gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

env = gym.make('YourCustomMayaEnv')
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=20000)
